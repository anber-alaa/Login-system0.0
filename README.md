# 🔐 Simple Authentication System

A **basic front-end authentication system** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with user credentials stored in the browser’s `localStorage`.  
Ideal for learning how authentication logic works on the front end without a backend server.

---

## 💡 Features

- ✅ Simple login & registration interface  
- ✅ Stores user credentials using `localStorage`  
- ✅ Form validation (empty fields, password match, etc.)  
- ✅ JavaScript-based authentication logic  
- ✅ Minimalist and responsive design

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Register:**  
   - User enters a username and password.  
   - Data is validated and stored in `localStorage`.

2. **Login:**  
   - User inputs credentials.  
   - Credentials are checked against data in `localStorage`.

3. **Access Control:**  
   - If login is successful, user is redirected to a protected homepage.  
   - No backend involved — all logic handled on the client side.
